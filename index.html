          Lofi has even progressed into a visual art style, commonly known as the “lofi aesthetic,” which is usually described as a vintage and static feel that uses simple and calm imagery to evoke feelings of nostalgia, comfort, and tranquility.

          This is perhaps the most popular genre of lofi. In general, lofi takes a lot of inspiration from hip hop — in particular, their use of drum loops to create rhythm – think Samurai Champloo & Nujabes

          Lofi jazz is often a more soothing genre than lofi hip hop. It makes the most use of string and wind instruments, and it contains a swing and syncopation typical to traditional jazz music. It is often associated with the bedroom pop genre because of how nostalgic lofi jazz sounds.

          Often described as hearing nightclub music from the outside, lofi house takes on a more upbeat rhythm compared to other lofi genres.

      What do I like about lofi music? Everything! It is literally the best. I listen to lofi music every second of my life. I'd call it an unhealthy addiction, but I'm only getting happier! We were born in the perfect era to witness the peak of musical creation.
